### Thank you for supporting the Stratos Groupbuy!

### What's in the box
- Acrylic case
- PCB
- Plate (FR4 / POM / ALU)
- Set of Gaskets
- Gasket Foam Layer
- Screws and Standofss
- Bumpons

Any extras should also be included in the box.

### Necessary Parts and Tools for Building
- Switches
- Stabilizers
- Keycaps
- USB-C Cable
- Sodlering Tools

Before building, please plug in th PCB and ensure that it functions correctly. 

## Step 1: Preparing PCB and Plate
1. Begin by adding stabilizers to the PCB. Double check to make sure the stabilizers are in the correct position for your desired layout.
2. Place the gasket foam layer on the PCB. 
3. Now, place the plate on top, sandwiching the gasket foam layer in bewteen the PCB and plate. 
4. Finally, add all of your switches to the plate and solder both pins to the PCB.

## Step 2: Preparing the Case
The case comes assembled with the paper left on the acrylic layers for extra protection during shipping. When disassembaling, try to keep the layers in the same order and in the same orientation, so that the case will be easy to reassemble. 

1. Start by removing the 10 screws on the top of the case and the 10 screws on the bottom of the case.
2. Remove each layer one by one, making sure to keep them in the same order and orienation, until all of the standoffs are removed.
3. Starting with the bottom-most layer, peel off the protective paper. Then, using the longest 4 standoffs, screw each standoff into the bottom layer. 
4. Continue to peel off the paper on the next layer. Slide this layer on the standoffs of the bottom layer. Using the second longest standoffs (there are 2 of them), screw each standoff into this layer. 
5. Peel off the paper of the next layer and stack it onto the other layers. 
6. Once again, peel off the paper of the next layer and stack it onto the other layers. Finally, screw the last 4 standoffs (the shortest ones) into the 4 holes left at the bottom of this layer. 
7. Continue to peel off the paper for the rest of the layers. Stack all of the layers onto the standoffs except for the top two layers. 

## Step 3: Applying the Gaskets
1. Use 6 of the long gaskets and apply them to the tabs on the plate. 
2. Place 6 of the small gaskets on the inner walls of the case. 

## Step 4: Completing the Build
1. Place the top two layers onto the standoffs and screw them into place with 10 screws. 
2. Add the four bumpons to the bottom of the case.
3. Add your favorite keycaps to complete the build!

## Configuring your PCB
1. Download the Via configurator [here](https://caniusevia.com/).
2. Plug in the PCB to your computer.
3. Open VIA. If the keyboard is not automatically recognized, then go to the "Design" tab and click "Load" to Load Draft Definition.
4. Upload the file "stratos.json" that is available in this repository.
5. Now you should be able to configure your layout.

Congratulations, you have completed your Stratos build!
